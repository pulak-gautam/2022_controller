This repository contains two components <br>
1. A sample code simulatiing an ideal inverted pendulum. The code also generates the control output using feedback loop.
This was done to get an overview idea of controllers.
2. A complete ROS package which implements position controller for ``husky`` (four-wheeled ground model) to move it to any desired position. This controller was written from scratch without using default PID controls provided by ``ros_control``.

Please refer to the respective README(s) fo the components for more details
