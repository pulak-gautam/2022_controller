This repository contains **two components** <br>
1. A sample code simulatiing an <a href="https://github.com/pulak-gautam/basic-controller-design/blob/main/simplified_inverted_pendulum_control/README.md"> **ideal inverted pendulum**</a>. The code also generates the control output using feedback loop.
This was done to get an overview idea of controllers.
2. A complete ROS package which implements <a href="https://github.com/pulak-gautam/basic-controller-design/blob/main/husky_pos_vel/README.md">**position controller for ``husky``**</a> (four-wheeled ground model) to move it to any desired position. This controller was written from scratch without using default PID controls provided by ``ros_control``.

Please refer to the respective README(s) fo the components for more details
